# Readme for Alembic Migrations

Alembic migration is used to properly manage database migrations, facilitating the process of evolving your database schema over time in a consistent and controlled manner. Alembic is a lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy, and it allows you to handle schema changes in a versioned way, making it easier to apply, track, and revert changes.

## Summary

We will be mainly be using the _--autogenerate_ feature of Alembic.

#### General flow of creating a new migration file and applying the migration

1. Update the models definition in `models.py`. Alembic will use this to generate the update migration scripts.
2. Run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<name of migration"`.
3. Apply the migration by `alembic upgrade head`.

To check if there are any changes to be made, you can run `alembic check`.
